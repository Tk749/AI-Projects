# Iris Dataset Classification
This project uses the famous Iris dataset for classification using various machine learning algorithms.

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and consists of three different species of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). This project demonstrates how to load the Iris dataset, visualize it, and perform classification using different machine learning models.
